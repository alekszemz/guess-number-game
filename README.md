# guess-number-game
This game is written in vanilla javascript and the goal of this project is to simply guess a secret number that is between one and twenty. Just type number in the input and the program shows you are right or not (you can see the message on the right side with a text that your guess is too low or too high). If you guess wrong scores on the right will be decreased by one but if you guess the correct number, the screen will become green and a question mark will be replaced with the correct number. To check the number press the "Check!" button to start a new game press the "Again!" button. See it here: https://alexzemz.github.io/guess-number-game/.
